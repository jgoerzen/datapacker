Description: Tool to pack files into minimum number of CDs/DVDs/etc
 datapacker is a tool to group files by size. It is
 designed to group files such that they fill fixed-size containers
 (called "bins") using the minimum number of containers. This is
 useful, for instance, if you want to archive a number of files to CD
 or DVD, and want to organize them such that you use the minimum
 possible number of CDs or DVDs.
 .
 In many cases, datapacker executes almost instantaneously. Of
 particular note, the hardlink action can be used
 to effectively copy data into bins without having to actually copy
 the data at all.
 .
 datapacker is a tool in the traditional Unix style; it can be used in
 pipes and call other tools.
